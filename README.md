## Summary 
### Engineering journey 🚀
- I decided to switch to software engineering because it gives me the mobility to work across a number of industries and I am excited by the wave of innovative companies in healthcare, retail, travel, energy, and insurance just to name a few. I am excited to bring my healthcare and start-up experience to engineering new technology products! 
### Life before engineering 👩‍⚕️
- Prior to engineering I worked in healthcare for 9 years in a variety of client-facing roles. 
- 5.5 years in health tech startups doing business development for Huma Therapeutics and LEO Innovation Lab. 
- 3.5 years as a health economist working in healthcare policy with the London School of Economics and then seconded to the Department of Health.

## Learning objectives 🔧🤠
