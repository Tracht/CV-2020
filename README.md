### Life before engineering

Prior to engineering I worked in healthcare for 9 years in a variety of client-facing roles. This includes 5.5 years in health tech startups doing business development for Huma Therapeutics and LEO Innovation Lab. I also worked in healthcare policy as a health economist for the other 3.5 years with the London School of Economics and then seconded to the Department of Health. <br> <br>
I have loved working in those roles as it gave me exposure to different parts of the healthcare system. I got to work with clinicians, patients, health policy advisors, and health tech entrepeneurs. The English NHS is rightly one of the most cherished government services and I am really glad to have been a part of many different teams and organisations looking to improve the delivery of NHS services so that people's care and experiences are of high standard and good quality. 
  
### Engineering journey

As much as I loved working in healthcare I felt that it was time for a change. Whilst working at Huma Therapeutics I spent some of my weekends learning how to code simple games in Python. I found that I enjoyed coding and time passed quickly and so I made the switch and enrolled in Makers Academy bootcamp in London. I've recently graduated and am now focusing on front-end technologies (mainly React) and learning various other tools like React Bootstrap, Styled Components, and React Hooks vs Classes. My next aim is to redo one of my projects and learn TypeScript!
