## Summary 
### Engineering journey 🚀
I wasn’t always a developer. I decided to make the switch because I enjoy building things. While I trained as a fullstack developer I do lean more to the front-end. I am a bit more of a creative type and like making and seeing beautiful things, especially when it is beautiful UI! 

### Life before engineering 👩‍⚕️
Prior to my career change I worked in healthcare in client-facing roles that were high-paced, demanding, but also really rewarding. About half of my work experience is in business development in health tech start-ups with companies based in London and Copenhagen. The other half was healthcare policy focused where I worked as a health economist. 

### Learning objectives 🤠
- **What am I learning now?** TypeScript, Redux & Redux Sagas.
